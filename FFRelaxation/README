# Instructions

This directory contains examples for relaxing the moir\'e superlattices using
forcefields as implemented in the LAMMPS package.

## Important Comment
*NOTE* Use of sw/mod for Stillinger-Weber potentials in Mass_FF. Please
       run them using the latest LAMMPS code. We checked our code with
       LAMMPS Jan. 2022 version.

If you wish to use older LAMMPS version, you must change the source code
of pair_sw.cpp for SW potentials as mentioned in the directory.

Tips on installing LAMMPS with the required packages are provided in
LAMMPS_INSTALL
